# Odoo document management module demo

## Setup

Install odoo 13 server in your system and launch it. Clone this repository and copy custom_document folder into your addons folder(you may need to configure that by editing odoo.conf). Login with admin account. On top left pop-up menu, go to Apps window. Install and activate Sales plugin. Again in top left menu, go to settings, scroll down and activate a developer mode. Go back to apps window. In the top bar, click on Update Apps List. Later, in search bar, disable all filters and search for 'document'. Select and install Custom Document Management module. Now in a top left menu a new entry called 'Documents Management' should appear.
